Usually, you are at risk of having the data you send and receive intercepted when you use an unsecured public network, like with a wifi hotspot in a cafe or at an airport. When you use a VPN, all communication between your computer and the endpoints of your connections are protected. All the data you transmit is encrypted on your device and only decrypted when it reaches its desired endpoint.

Horizen is working on a decentralized VPN network that will allow you to access the internet without giving up your privacy. A VPN - or Virtual Private Network - is a secure tunnel between two or more devices. For example, many companies require their employees to use a VPN when they work remotely so that they can access the company's private network as if they were on site,without the risk of data leaks.

VPNs also allow you to access services that are normally blocked in your region. By connecting to an endpoint that is within the service's area - even if it's on another continent - you can "pretend" to be there. If you connect to an endpoint in the United States, nobody can tell where the connection originates. This is especially useful to people in countries with authoritarian regimes, which tend to limit access to the world wide web. Not only do they block certain services like streaming websites or social networks, but sometimes they also limit access to basic information that should be accessible to every person in the world.

Horizen has one of the largest node networks in the industry and every Secure and Super Node is a potential endpoint for a VPN. We want to put this resource to use so that our users and our ecosystem benefit alike. Node operators can choose to support our decentralized VPN solution, and will get paid directly by the users for their node's VPN services.

We can't discuss further details on our VPN solution, but we will update this article as soon as we can.
